# Investigatory-Project-2019
This was written by myself for my final exam and as part of graduation from the Computer Science course at my high school

This project implements class objects and data file handling concepts to create, read and modify the periodic table as a binary file.

The elements and their information are stored in a data file, that can be accessed through the program. It allows for search by name, symbol, atomic number and atomic mass. The project includes functions that can search for an element, modify an element, add a new element and delete an existing element.
